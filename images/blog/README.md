# Blog Images Directory

This directory contains images used in blog posts on HelloEmily.dev.

## Folder Structure

Each blog post has its own dedicated folder for images:

- `sean-website/` - Images for the Sean's Website case study
- `ai-ethics/` - Images for the AI Ethics blog post
- `io-puzzle/` - Images for the Google I/O Puzzles blog post

To add images for a new blog post, create a new folder with a name that matches the blog post topic.

## Image Guidelines

- Featured images should be 1200x630px for optimal display
- Use descriptive filenames that match the blog post topic
- Optimize images for web before uploading
- Store all images for a specific post in that post's folder
