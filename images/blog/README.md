# Blog Images Directory

This directory contains images used in blog posts on HelloEmily.dev.

## Folder Structure

Each blog post has its own dedicated folder for images:

- `sean-website/` - Images for the Sean's Website case study
- `ai-ethics/` - Images for the AI Ethics blog post
- `io-puzzle/` - Images for the Google I/O Puzzles blog post

To add images for a new blog post, create a new folder with a name that matches the blog post topic.

## Image Naming Convention

All blog images must follow this strict naming convention:

1. **Featured Image**: Each blog post folder must have one featured image named:
   - `[folder-name]-featured.jpg` (e.g., `ai-ethics-featured.jpg`)

2. **Additional Images**: Any additional images in the folder should be named:
   - `[folder-name]-1.jpg`, `[folder-name]-2.jpg`, etc.
   - Example: `gen-ai-enterprise-1.jpg`, `gen-ai-enterprise-2.jpg`

This naming convention ensures consistency across the blog and makes it easier to manage images.

## Image Guidelines

- Featured images should be 1200x630px for optimal display
- Optimize all images for web before uploading
- Store all images for a specific post in that post's folder
