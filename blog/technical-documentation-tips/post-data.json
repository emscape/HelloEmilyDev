  "shortDescription": "Tips for creating effective technical documentation that users will actually read",
  "content": "<p>Let’s be honest—writing documentation rarely makes the highlight reel. It's often treated like the broccoli of software development: necessary, good for you, but never the first thing folks reach for. But great docs? Great docs <em>change lives</em>. Or at the very least, they stop Slack from turning into a support hotline.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I’ve helped build products that <em>needed</em> documentation to succeed. I’ve also spent plenty of late nights reverse-engineering someone else’s barely-documented PL/SQL methods. (Not naming names. You know who you are.) Whether you're a solo dev or wrangling a sprawling enterprise system, here are some things I wish more people remembered:</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>Know Your Audience</h3>\n<p>Start with empathy. A beginner stumbling through your onboarding flow and a senior dev trying to integrate your SDK are on <em>very</em> different journeys. Write with their perspectives in mind. Avoid jargon unless you know your audience eats acronyms for breakfast. And if you're not sure who your audience is? Pause. Go find out. You can’t help people if you don’t know who they are.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>Structure for Scannability</h3>\n<p>Real talk: nobody reads documentation like a novel. They skim. They Ctrl+F. They scroll until they spot the code snippet they need. So help them out. Use short sections, headers that act like signposts, and formatting that says, “You’re in the right place.” Think: bullet points, tables, and code blocks that are easy on the eyes—even at 2 AM.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>Include Practical Examples</h3>\n<p>Theory is nice, but users want to see <em>how it actually works</em>. Whenever possible, ground your docs in reality. Sample API calls. Full copy-paste-ready code blocks. Step-by-step tutorials that walk people through your most common use cases. (Bonus points if you’ve tested them in a clean environment. Nothing like a \"this should work\" moment to lose someone's trust.)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>Maintain and Update Regularly</h3>\n<p>Outdated documentation is a trap disguised as help. Few things frustrate users more than following instructions that worked six versions ago. Schedule time to review and refresh your docs. Tie updates to release cycles. Or set calendar reminders. Or write it as you go along. However you do it—just do it.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>Incorporate Visual Elements</h3>\n<p>A well-placed screenshot, diagram, or explainer video can sometimes cut through confusion better than three paragraphs of prose. Visuals don’t replace words, but they <em>anchor</em> them. And no, you don’t have to be a graphic designer—simple, accurate, and up-to-date goes a long way.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h3>Gather and Implement Feedback</h3>\n<p>Documentation is never “done.” Invite users to point out gaps, unclear sections, or broken examples. Consider a feedback widget, or even a “Was this helpful?” thumbs-up system. (Just... respond to the feedback. Nobody wants to yell into a void.)</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Documentation isn't just a support artifact—it’s a core part of the user experience. When done right, it reduces friction, builds trust, and makes people feel <em>smart</em> when they interact with your product. That’s the goal, right?</p>\n<p>Now go forth and write the docs. Or update them. Or maybe just start by fixing that one broken link you’ve been ignoring. I’ll be here to cheer you on—with linting tips, Markdown formatting help, and possibly a bedtime reminder if it’s getting late.</p>",
