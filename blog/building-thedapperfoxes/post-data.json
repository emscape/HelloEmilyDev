  "title": "Building TheDapperFoxes.com: A Website Worthy of a Love Story",
  "shortDescription": "How we designed and built a wedding website that reflects our personalities, aesthetics, and engineering strengths.",
  "content": "<p>When we set out to build our wedding website, we knew we wanted it to reflect <em>us</em>‚Äînot just the event, but the vibe. Something charming, a little cheeky, visually cohesive, and flexible enough to hold everything from heartfelt backstory to guest-uploaded chaos. Enter: <strong>TheDapperFoxes.com</strong>.</p>\n<h3>üé® The Aesthetic</h3>\n<p>We built the look around our signature colors: <strong>teal and sunset orange</strong>, with accents of silver and soft neutrals. The palette blends modern and whimsical, with enough contrast to keep things lively. Our favicon‚Äîtwo foxes in love, complete with top hat and veil‚Äîbecame the visual heartbeat of the site. (And yes, they‚Äôre in love. Obviously.)</p>\n<h3>üõ†Ô∏è The Tools</h3>\n<p>The site runs on custom code collaboratively written by Emily and Roo, her agentic AI dev assistant‚ÄîEmily handled the logic, flow, and integration while Roo helped streamline repetitive tasks. Sean, naturally, gave all copy the British polish test. We used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> for hosting</li>\n<li><strong>Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS</strong> for custom behavior</li>\n<li>A sprinkle of <strong>Apps Script</strong> to power photo submission approvals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also wrangled Google Forms, Sheets, and Drive in ways that Google did not intend‚Äîbecause of course we did.</p>\n<h3>üì∏ The Photo Gallery</h3>\n<p>One of the best parts? Our collaborative photo gallery. Guests can upload their own shots to contribute to our slideshow‚Äîand approve them via a private, login-only interface. It took a few headaches (Glide, AppSheet, and API permission gremlins were all involved), but we got there.</p>\n<h3>üìç The Poll</h3>\n<p>We built an interactive poll to help friends and family weigh in on potential wedding locations. It‚Äôs not binding (we are not monsters), but it‚Äôs a delightful way to include the community‚Äîand play with our color palette logic, which assigns each location a unique shade from one of three curated families.</p>\n<h3>üíª The Experience</h3>\n<p>In the end, TheDapperFoxes.com became more than just a wedding website‚Äîit‚Äôs a showcase of systems thinking disguised as whimsy. From architecture to copy, every element reflects thoughtful design, seamless integration, and an unapologetically human touch.</p>\n<p>We used Google Apps Script to create lightweight, secure approval flows for both the guest photo gallery and the location poll comment feature. These scripts handle the moderation logic behind the scenes, allowing us to manage guest-generated content gracefully‚Äîwithout introducing friction for the user.</p>\n<p>Emily led the development from concept to execution, blending aesthetics with infrastructure and handling everything from cross-platform automation to interface consistency. Building it as a couple was part of the fun‚Äîmaking it scale gracefully across form responses, guest engagement, and emotional tone? That was the challenge. And the reward.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong>Coming soon:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Events</li>\n<li>RSVP</li>\n<li>Registry</li>\n<li>More Easter eggs ü•ö</li>\n</ul>\n<p><div align=\"right\"><sub><em>Powered by Sparky ‚ö°Ô∏è</em></sub></div></p>",
