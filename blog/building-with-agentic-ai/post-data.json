  "content": "<h1>Building With Agentic AI</h1>\n<p><em>Presented at Google Playa Vista - The Spruce Goose Hangar on August 22, 2025</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>From Automation Anxiety to Orchestration Mastery</h2>\n<p>The conversation around AI and developers has been dominated by one question: &quot;Will AI replace programmers?&quot; But that&#39;s the wrong question. The real question is: &quot;How do we move from fearing automation to mastering orchestration?&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Building With Agentic AI</strong> explores this mindset shift and shows how next-generation AI tools are designed to empower developers, not replace them. These aren&#39;t just smarter autocomplete tools—they&#39;re collaborative partners that can work alongside humans across the entire development lifecycle.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What Makes AI &quot;Agentic&quot;?</h2>\n<p>Traditional AI tools are reactive—they respond to prompts and generate outputs. Agentic AI systems are different. They can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plan and strategize</strong> across multiple steps</li>\n<li><strong>Use tools autonomously</strong> to accomplish goals</li>\n<li><strong>Iterate and refine</strong> their approach based on feedback</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborate</strong> with humans in real-time</li>\n<li><strong>Learn from context</strong> and adapt their behavior</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This isn&#39;t about replacing human judgment—it&#39;s about augmenting human capability.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>\n<h3>Architecture &amp; Design</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Autonomous system design and documentation</li>\n<li>Code review and optimization suggestions</li>\n<li>Architecture decision records (ADRs) generation</li>\n<li>Technical debt analysis and remediation planning</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Development &amp; Coding</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Context-aware code generation</li>\n<li>Intelligent debugging and error resolution</li>\n<li>Automated testing and validation</li>\n<li>Cross-platform compatibility checks</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation &amp; Communication</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Living documentation that updates with code changes</li>\n<li>Automated API documentation generation</li>\n<li>Technical writing assistance and editing</li>\n<li>Knowledge base maintenance</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Case Study: Productizer</h2>\n<p>One of the most exciting examples I shared was <strong>Productizer</strong>—an AI-powered product analysis tool with a delightfully monstrous personality. This demo showcased:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autonomous research capabilities</strong> - The AI agent could analyze products, gather market data, and provide insights without constant human guidance</li>\n<li><strong>Creative problem-solving</strong> - It didn&#39;t just follow scripts; it adapted its analysis approach based on the product type</li>\n<li><strong>Personality-driven interaction</strong> - The &quot;monstrous&quot; personality made the tool memorable and engaging while maintaining professional utility</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Productizer demonstrated that agentic AI doesn&#39;t have to be sterile or robotic—it can have character while delivering real business value.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Developer&#39;s New Role: AI Orchestrator</h2>\n<p>As AI becomes more capable, developers aren&#39;t becoming obsolete—we&#39;re becoming <strong>orchestrators</strong>. This means:</p>\n<h3>Strategic Thinking</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Defining system requirements and constraints</li>\n<li>Making architectural decisions</li>\n<li>Balancing trade-offs and priorities</li>\n<li>Ensuring ethical and responsible AI use</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Validating AI-generated code and solutions</li>\n<li>Testing edge cases and error conditions</li>\n<li>Maintaining security and performance standards</li>\n<li>Ensuring accessibility and user experience</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Creative Problem-Solving</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tackling novel challenges that require human insight</li>\n<li>Bridging business requirements with technical solutions</li>\n<li>Innovating new approaches and methodologies</li>\n<li>Building systems that AI tools can&#39;t yet imagine</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Best Practices for Agentic AI Development</h2>\n<h3>1. Start with Clear Objectives</h3>\n<p>Define what success looks like before deploying agentic systems. Vague goals lead to unpredictable outcomes.</p>\n<h3>2. Implement Guardrails</h3>\n<p>Set boundaries on what your AI agents can and cannot do. Autonomy without limits is chaos.</p>\n<h3>3. Maintain Human Oversight</h3>\n<p>Always have humans in the loop for critical decisions. AI should augment judgment, not replace it.</p>\n<h3>4. Design for Transparency</h3>\n<p>Build systems where you can understand and explain AI decision-making processes.</p>\n<h3>5. Plan for Iteration</h3>\n<p>Agentic AI systems improve over time. Design your workflows to incorporate learning and refinement.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Future of Human-AI Collaboration</h2>\n<p>We&#39;re entering an era where the most productive developers won&#39;t be those who can code the fastest—they&#39;ll be those who can <strong>orchestrate AI systems most effectively</strong>. This requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technical skills</strong> to understand AI capabilities and limitations</li>\n<li><strong>Strategic thinking</strong> to design effective human-AI workflows</li>\n<li><strong>Communication skills</strong> to work with AI as a collaborative partner</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptability</strong> to evolve with rapidly advancing AI capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Embrace the shift</strong> from automation anxiety to orchestration mastery</li>\n<li><strong>Think of AI as a collaborative partner</strong>, not a replacement</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on uniquely human skills</strong> like strategic thinking and creative problem-solving</li>\n<li><strong>Experiment with agentic tools</strong> to understand their capabilities and limitations</li>\n<li><strong>Design systems with humans in the loop</strong> for critical decisions</li>\n<li><strong>Stay curious and adaptable</strong> as AI capabilities continue to evolve</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2>What&#39;s Next?</h2>\n<p>The agentic AI revolution is just beginning. As these tools become more sophisticated and accessible, the developers who thrive will be those who learn to work <strong>with</strong> AI rather than <strong>against</strong> it.</p>\n<p>The question isn&#39;t whether AI will change how we build software—it&#39;s how quickly we can adapt to become better orchestrators, strategists, and innovators in this new landscape.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>This post is based on my presentation &quot;Building With Agentic AI&quot; delivered at Google Playa Vista on August 22, 2025.
