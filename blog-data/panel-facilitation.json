Both were powerful platforms to bring together brilliant women making waves in technology, and I am honored to have played a role in amplifying their voices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe DevFest and International Women\u0027s Day events hosted by Google Developer Groups (GDG) Los Angeles were vibrant, collaborative spaces for fostering connections and sharing knowledge. Here’s a look back at some of the amazing panelists who shared their insights, challenges, and stories in the world of tech:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003ePanelists\r\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIsabel Tewes\u003c/strong\u003e, Senior Product Manager at Google, provided insights on product management and how critical it is to have diverse perspectives driving product strategy.\r\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eKey Takeaways\r\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese panelists brought diverse perspectives across various roles in tech—from software engineering and product management to AI and cybersecurity. What struck me most was their shared commitment to making technology more inclusive and ensuring that future generations of women in tech have the resources and support they need to succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the core themes of the discussion was overcoming barriers in tech, particularly those related to gender and racial diversity. Each panelist had unique stories about challenges they\u0027ve faced, but what stood out was their resilience and how they turned those challenges into opportunities for growth, mentorship, and leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother key theme was the importance of mentorship. Many panelists highlighted how having a mentor or being a mentor themselves has been instrumental in their personal and professional development. It’s clear that mentorship is a crucial aspect of growing the pipeline of women in tech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eFacilitating the Conversation\r\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFacilitating this panel was an enriching experience.

I worked to create an environment where everyone felt heard and empowered to offer their insights. It was a great reminder of the power of shared experiences in shaping the next generation of women in technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversations that unfolded were not just technical discussions—they were about the human experience of navigating the tech landscape. We talked about finding our voices in spaces where women are still underrepresented, about the power of community, and about the strides we’ve made, as well as the work that still needs to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat’s Next?\r\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we celebrate the incredible women in tech who are pushing boundaries, I’m excited to continue engaging with this vibrant community and helping amplify their voices. The future of tech is bright, and it’s clear that women are playing a key role in shaping it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI am grateful to have had the chance to contribute to these discussions and look forward to seeing what these amazing women will do next.
