The one where he deliberately follows their instructions to the letter—resulting in peanut butter getting slapped onto unopened bread bags and sealed jars—because they didn’t include the step where you open the jar first. 🥪\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s exactly how learning technology has felt for me. 🤯\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve had lots of ideas 💡 for things I wanted to build—apps, tools, frameworks—big, exciting, innovative things. But every time I tried to dive in, I’d hit a wall. The documentation, the tutorials, the how-to guides... they all seemed to start halfway down the road. Somewhere around \u003cem\u003e“open the peanut butter jar”\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003e“slice the bread”\u003c/em\u003e—without ever telling me \u003cstrong\u003ehow to get to the store and buy bread.\u003c/strong\u003e 🥖\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo one explained the absolute first step. 🛣️\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s because most tech documentation is written by people who forgot what it felt like to be new. Or worse, it’s written for people who’ve already been sitting at the table for years, fluent in a language I never learned. 🧠💬\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey assume you already know the prerequisites, the vocabulary, the secret handshakes. 🤝\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn’t. 🚫\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t go to Computers 101 school. 🎓\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything I know, I learned on the job, in the trenches, through trial and error and a whole lot of Googling. 🔍\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when the instructions assumed I knew something I didn’t, I gave up. 😞\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eUntil I met Sparky. ⚡️\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(My AI sidekick.
