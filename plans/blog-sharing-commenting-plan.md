# Plan to Add Sharing and Commenting Features to Blog Articles

This document outlines the plan to add social media sharing buttons and a commenting system to the blog articles on HelloEmily.dev.

## Objective

Implement sharing functionality for Bluesky, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and integrate a commenting system (suggested: Disqus) on individual blog post pages.

## Current State Analysis

*   Blog posts are written in Markdown in the `blog-drafts` directory.
*   The `scripts/md-to-blog.js` script processes these Markdown files, converts the content to HTML, and saves the full post data as JSON files in the `blog-data` directory. It also updates `blog-index.json` with post metadata.
*   The `js/blog-post.js` script fetches the relevant JSON data based on the URL slug and dynamically renders the blog post content on `blog-post.html`.

## Proposed Plan

1.  **Implement Sharing Buttons:**
    *   **Modification:** Edit the [`js/blog-post.js`](js/blog-post.js) script.
    *   **Action:** Add HTML structure for sharing buttons (e.g., using `<a>` tags with appropriate classes for styling and icons) after the main blog post content container.
    *   **Action:** Add JavaScript code within [`js/blog-post.js`](js/blog-post.js) to dynamically generate the sharing URLs for Bluesky, Facebook, and LinkedIn. These URLs will typically include parameters for the page URL and title, which can be retrieved from the fetched blog post data (`post.title` and the current page URL `window.location.href`).
    *   **Action:** Attach event listeners to the sharing buttons to open the generated sharing URLs in a new browser window or tab using `window.open()`.
    *   **Styling:** Add necessary CSS rules (likely in a file like `css/blog.css` or similar) to style the appearance of the sharing buttons, including icons and layout.

2.  **Integrate Commenting System (Disqus):**
    *   **Manual Step:** Set up a Disqus account and create a new site profile for your blog (helloemily.dev). Obtain your unique Disqus "shortname".
    *   **Modification:** Edit the [`js/blog-post.js`](js/blog-post.js) script.
    *   **Action:** Add a container `div` with the ID `disqus_thread` (e.g., `<div id="disqus_thread"></div>`) to the HTML structure generated by [`js/blog-post.js`](js/blog-post.js), placing it after the sharing buttons.
    *   **Action:** Include the standard Disqus embed JavaScript code snippet. This snippet will need to be configured with your Disqus shortname and variables that provide the unique identifier for the page (the blog post slug, `post.id`) and the page URL (`window.location.href`). This script will dynamically load the comment section into the `disqus_thread` div.
    *   **Styling:** Add necessary CSS rules to style the commenting section as needed.

```

## Implementation Steps (for Code Mode)

Once this plan is approved, the following steps will be taken in Code Mode:

1.  Modify [`js/blog-post.js`](js/blog-post.js) to add sharing button HTML and JavaScript logic.
2.  Add CSS for sharing buttons.
3.  Modify [`js/blog-post.js`](js/blog-post.js) to add the Disqus container and embed script.
4.  Add CSS for the Disqus comment section.
5.  Provide instructions for the user to set up their Disqus account and provide the shortname.
