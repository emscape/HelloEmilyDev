I recently had the opportunity to visit NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)â€”a behind-the-scenes glimpse into some of the most iconic space exploration missions of our time. From the Mars Yard and Mission Control to the Europa Clipper and Mars Sample Return plans, the experience was unforgettable.

To commemorate the trip, I put together a presentation using an AI slide generatorâ€”my first time leveraging generative tools to build a deck. While I added my own context and commentary throughout, the majority of the structure and visuals came straight from the AI. It turned out to be a fun experiment in letting technology help tell the story of... technology.

Check out the highlights from my visit, learn more about the incredible work happening at JPL, and follow along as I continue to explore how AI can streamline storytellingâ€”on Earth and beyond. ðŸŒŒ
