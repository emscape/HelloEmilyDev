From the Mars Yard and Mission Control to the Europa Clipper and Mars Sample Return plans, the experience was unforgettable.\n\nTo commemorate the trip, I put together a presentation using an AI slide generatorâ€”my first time leveraging generative tools to build a deck. While I added my own context and commentary throughout, the majority of the structure and visuals came straight from the AI. It turned out to be a fun experiment in letting technology help tell the story of... technology.\n\nCheck out the highlights from my visit, learn more about the incredible work happening at JPL, and follow along as I continue to explore how AI can streamline storytellingâ€”on Earth and beyond. ðŸŒŒ",
