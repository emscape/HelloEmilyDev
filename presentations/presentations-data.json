    "longDescriptionMarkdown": "---\ntitle: \"A Journey Through the Cosmos: My First AI-Generated Slide Adventure ðŸš€\"\n---\n\nI had the incredible opportunity to visit NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for a behind-the-scenes look at the missions shaping the future of space exploration. From the Mars Yard and Mission Control to the Europa Clipper and Mars Sample Return, it was a dream come true. To commemorate the experience, I created a slide deck using a generative AI toolâ€”my first time experimenting with AI-powered storytelling. While I provided the voice and context, the structure and visuals were shaped by the AI. It was a fun and surprisingly effective way to blend personal narrative with emerging tech.",

    "longDescriptionMarkdown": "---\ntitle: \"Generative AI: Considerations for Use in Corporate Enterprises\"\n---\n\nPresented at GDG Twin Cities, this talk dives into how generative AI is transforming the enterprise landscape. I explore its practical applications across industries, from content creation to automation, while unpacking the critical risks that come with implementation. Topics include model security, data privacy, ethical concerns, and long-term governance. The session serves as both a primer and a call-to-action for leaders navigating the evolving AI ecosystem. It also marked one of my earliest uses of generative tools to structure and design a presentationâ€”an experiment in letting AI help explain itself."

This session explores how inclusive design, emotional nuance, and user-centered research can be used to build more empathetic AI systems. I share real-world examples of where emotional AI gets it wrongâ€”and where it gets it rightâ€”with insights on designing systems that better understand human context. This was my second experiment using AI to generate a slide deck, pairing personal insight with emerging tools to rethink how we teach machines to understand us."
