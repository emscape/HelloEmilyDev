"Building With Agentic AI" explores how next-generation AI tools empower developers rather than replace them. This presentation walks through the mindset shift from automation anxiety to orchestration mastery—showing how agentic systems can collaborate with humans across architecture, coding, debugging, and documentation. It also dives into real examples of autonomous project builds and creative demos like Productizer, an AI-powered product analysis tool with a delightfully monstrous personality. Presented at Google Playa Vista - The Spruce Goose Hangar on August 22, 2025.
