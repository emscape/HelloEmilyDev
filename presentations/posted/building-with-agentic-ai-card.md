# Building With Agentic AI

## Overview

"Building With Agentic AI" explores how next-generation AI tools empower developers rather than replace them. This presentation walks through the mindset shift from automation anxiety to orchestration masteryâ€”showing how agentic systems can collaborate with humans across architecture, coding, debugging, and documentation.

## Key Topics

- The evolution from reactive AI to agentic AI systems
- Real-world applications across the development lifecycle
- Case study: Productizer (AI-powered product analysis tool with personality)
- The developer's new role as AI orchestrator
- Best practices for human-AI collaboration
- Strategic thinking and quality assurance in AI-augmented development

## Audience

Developers, engineering leaders, and technologists interested in understanding how to work effectively with autonomous AI systems while maintaining human oversight and creativity.

## Key Takeaways

- Embrace orchestration mastery over automation anxiety
- Think of AI as a collaborative partner, not a replacement
- Focus on uniquely human skills: strategic thinking and creative problem-solving
- Design systems with humans in the loop for critical decisions
- Stay adaptable as AI capabilities continue to evolve
