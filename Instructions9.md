# Removing GitHub Actions from HelloEmily.dev

## Purpose
This document outlines the steps taken to remove GitHub Actions from the HelloEmily.dev project. GitHub Actions was previously used for automated deployment to GitHub Pages, but has been removed to simplify the project structure and resolve issues with the automated deployment process.

## Steps Taken

1. **Identified GitHub Actions Components**
   - Located the GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Identified references to GitHub Actions in project documentation

2. **Removed GitHub Actions Structure**
   - Deleted the entire `.github` directory containing the workflow configuration
   - Updated PromptContext.md to reflect the removal of GitHub Actions
   - Created this Instructions9.md file to document the process

3. **Updated Project Documentation**
   - Modified the Status section in PromptContext.md
   - Updated the deployment_process information in the JSON configuration

## Impact on Deployment

With GitHub Actions removed, the site will no longer automatically deploy when changes are pushed to the main branch. This means:

1. **Manual Deployment Required**: Changes to the site will need to be manually deployed to GitHub Pages
2. **More Control**: You now have direct control over when and how the site is deployed
3. **Simplified Structure**: The project structure is now simpler without the GitHub Actions configuration

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Option 1: Manual GitHub Pages Deployment
1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to the "Pages" section
3. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually "main")
4. Click "Save"

### Option 2: Local Build and Push
1. Make your changes locally
2. Test the site locally
3. Commit and push changes to GitHub
4. GitHub Pages will deploy from your selected branch

### Option 3: Third-Party Deployment Services
If you need automated deployments in the future, consider using third-party services like:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages

These services offer free tiers for static sites and can be configured to automatically deploy when changes are pushed to your repository.

## Next Steps

1. Choose your preferred deployment method from the options above
2. Update your workflow to include manual deployment steps if needed
3. Test the deployment process to ensure the site continues to function correctly
