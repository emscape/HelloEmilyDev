# Instructions 7: Website Content Integration

## What We've Done

We've updated the website to properly integrate the content objects gathered in the previous task:

1. **Fixed JavaScript Path Issues**:
   - Updated relative paths in `site-config.js` to correctly load content files
   - Changed `../content/site-metadata.json` to `./content/site-metadata.json`
   - Changed `../content/about-me.md` to `./content/about-me.md`
   - Updated relative paths in `projects.js` to correctly load project data
   - Changed `../projects/projects-data.json` to `./projects/projects-data.json`

2. **Fixed Image Paths**:
   - Updated image paths in `io-puzzle-2025.md` to use correct relative paths
   - Changed `../images/projects/io-puzzle-*.jpg` to `./images/projects/io-puzzle-*.jpg`

## Content Integration

The website now correctly loads:
- Professional bio from `about-me.md`
- Site configuration from `site-metadata.json`
- Skills and navigation from site metadata
- Project information from `projects-data.json`
- Detailed project descriptions from markdown files

## Next Steps for Image Integration

The image placeholders are still in place. When you're ready to add images to the website, refer to the instructions in the image source files located in each image directory.

## How to Test Your Website

After downloading the images, you can test your website locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Verify that your about content loads correctly
3. Check that your projects display properly
4. Ensure all links work as expected

## Next Steps

1. **Push Changes to Git**:
   - Commit the path fixes and new instructions file
   - Push to GitHub to update the live site

2. **Content Refinement**:
   - Review and edit the content to ensure accuracy
   - Add any additional details or projects you'd like to showcase

3. **Design Customization**:
   - Adjust the CSS to match your preferred color scheme and style
   - Customize the layout for different sections if needed

4. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Test the website on various devices
   - Make any necessary adjustments for mobile responsiveness
