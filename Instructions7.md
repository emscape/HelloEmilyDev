# Instructions 7: Website Content Integration

## What We've Done

We've updated the website to properly integrate the content objects gathered in the previous task:

1. **Fixed JavaScript Path Issues**:
   - Updated relative paths in `site-config.js` to correctly load content files
   - Changed `../content/site-metadata.json` to `./content/site-metadata.json`
   - Changed `../content/about-me.md` to `./content/about-me.md`
   - Updated relative paths in `projects.js` to correctly load project data
   - Changed `../projects/projects-data.json` to `./projects/projects-data.json`

2. **Fixed Image Paths**:
   - Updated image paths in `io-puzzle-2025.md` to use correct relative paths
   - Changed `../images/projects/io-puzzle-*.jpg` to `./images/projects/io-puzzle-*.jpg`

## Content Integration

The website now correctly loads:
- Professional bio from `about-me.md`
- Site configuration from `site-metadata.json`
- Skills and navigation from site metadata
- Project information from `projects-data.json`
- Detailed project descriptions from markdown files

## Manual Steps Still Required

As mentioned in Instructions6.md, you'll still need to:

1. **Download Profile Images**:
   - Follow instructions in `images/profile/image-sources.md`
   - Save your professional headshot from emilysueanderson.com

2. **Download Project Images**:
   - Follow instructions in `images/projects/image-sources.md`
   - Save screenshots of your I/O Puzzle solutions and Google Tutorials

3. **Download Background Images**:
   - Follow instructions in `images/backgrounds/image-sources.md`
   - Save background images from your websites

## How to Test Your Website

After downloading the images, you can test your website locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Verify that your about content loads correctly
3. Check that your projects display properly
4. Ensure all links work as expected

## Next Steps

1. **Push Changes to Git**:
   - Commit the path fixes and new instructions file
   - Push to GitHub to update the live site

2. **Content Refinement**:
   - Review and edit the content to ensure accuracy
   - Add any additional details or projects you'd like to showcase

3. **Design Customization**:
   - Adjust the CSS to match your preferred color scheme and style
   - Customize the layout for different sections if needed

4. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Test the website on various devices
   - Make any necessary adjustments for mobile responsiveness
