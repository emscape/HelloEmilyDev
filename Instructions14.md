## Task Overview
Integrate images into the website and prepare for pushing changes live.

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Image Integration
- Updated `index.html` to replace the profile image placeholder with the actual image
- Added CSS styles for the profile image in `styles.css`
- The profile image now appears in the About section with proper styling

### 2. Background Hero Image Integration
- Updated the hero section in `styles.css` to use the background image
- Added a semi-transparent teal overlay to maintain readability of text
- Ensured proper z-indexing for the content to appear above the overlay

### 3. Project Images Integration

- Created a hover effect for project images
- Added proper structure to project cards with content in a separate div

### 4. File Path Corrections
- Updated `projects-data.json` to fix the file extension for `website-mobile.png` (was incorrectly referenced as .jpg)
- Updated image paths in `projects-data.json` to use the correct file extensions (.jpeg instead of .jpg for io-puzzle images)

### 5. Additional Styling Improvements
- Added styles for the secondary button used in project links
- Added styles for the project links container
- Updated the fallback projects function to match the new structure

### 6. Script Integration
- Added the projects.js script to index.html to ensure dynamic project loading

## How to Push Changes Live

Since GitHub Actions has been completely removed (as noted in PromptContext.md), manual deployment is required. Follow these steps to push changes live:

1. Commit all changes to the repository
2. Push the changes to the GitHub repository
3. GitHub Pages will automatically update with the new changes (may take a few minutes)

## Verification Steps
After pushing changes live:
1. Visit HelloEmily.dev to verify the website is updated
2. Check that all images are displaying correctly
3. Test responsiveness on different devices
4. Verify that project cards are displaying properly with images

## Next Steps
1. Continue with mobile optimization as mentioned in PromptContext.md
2. Consider adding more project details or expanding the portfolio section
3. Add more social media links in the contact section
