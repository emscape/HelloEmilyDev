## Short Description
A concise summary of your blog post. This will be used for previews and potentially meta descriptions. Keep it to a sentence or two.

## Content
This is where the main body of your blog post goes.
You can use Markdown formatting like:

### Subheadings

- Bulleted lists
- Like this one

**Bold text** and *italic text*.

[Links to other pages](https://example.com)

And any other Markdown your basic converter in `md-to-blog.js` supports (or that a more advanced parser would handle if you upgrade it).
Remember, the current script converts this entire section into a single HTML string.
