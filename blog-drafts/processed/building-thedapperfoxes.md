When we set out to build our wedding website, we knew we wanted it to reflect *us*—not just the event, but the vibe. Something charming, a little cheeky, visually cohesive, and flexible enough to hold everything from heartfelt backstory to guest-uploaded chaos. Enter: **[TheDapperFoxes.com](https://www.thedapperfoxes.com)**.

### 🎨 The Aesthetic

We built the look around our signature colors: **teal and sunset orange**, with accents of silver and soft neutrals. The palette blends modern and whimsical, with enough contrast to keep things lively. Our favicon—two foxes in love, complete with top hat and veil—became the visual heartbeat of the site. (And yes, they’re in love. Obviously.)

### 🛠️ The Tools

The site runs on custom code collaboratively written by Emily and Roo, her agentic AI dev assistant—Emily handled the logic, flow, and integration while Roo helped streamline repetitive tasks. Sean, naturally, gave all copy the British polish test. We used:

- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS** for custom behavior
- A sprinkle of **Apps Script** to power photo submission approvals

We also wrangled Google Forms, Sheets, and Drive in ways that Google did not intend—because of course we did.

### 📸 The Photo Gallery

One of the best parts? Our collaborative photo gallery. Guests can upload their own shots to contribute to our slideshow—and approve them via a private, login-only interface. It took a few headaches (Glide, AppSheet, and API permission gremlins were all involved), but we got there.

### 📍 The Poll

We built an interactive poll to help friends and family weigh in on potential wedding locations. It’s not binding (we are not monsters), but it’s a delightful way to include the community—and play with our color palette logic, which assigns each location a unique shade from one of three curated families.

### 💻 The Experience

In the end, TheDapperFoxes.com became more than just a wedding website—it’s a showcase of systems thinking disguised as whimsy. From architecture to copy, every element reflects thoughtful design, seamless integration, and an unapologetically human touch.

We used Google Apps Script to create lightweight, secure approval flows for both the guest photo gallery and the location poll comment feature. These scripts handle the moderation logic behind the scenes, allowing us to manage guest-generated content gracefully—without introducing friction for the user.

Emily led the development from concept to execution, blending aesthetics with infrastructure and handling everything from cross-platform automation to interface consistency. Building it as a couple was part of the fun—making it scale gracefully across form responses, guest engagement, and emotional tone? That was the challenge. And the reward.
