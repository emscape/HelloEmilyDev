### Introduction

In September 2023, I had the incredible opportunity to tour NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, guided by our brilliant friend, Dr. Eric Huff. A physicist with a passion for precision cosmology and a talent for engaging storytelling, Dr. Huff offered us a private, deeply insightful look into the forefront of robotic space exploration.

What made this visit even more memorable? I decided to turn the experience into a presentation using an AI-powered slide generator. This was my first time experimenting with AI in the context of building slide decks—and let’s just say, I may never go back.

### Highlights from the Tour

The agenda was packed, and every stop deepened my appreciation for the work being done at JPL:

- **Mars Yard**: A simulated Martian terrain where rovers undergo rigorous pre-launch testing.
- **Mission Control**: The nerve center of space communication, buzzing with real-time data and quiet intensity.
- **The Spacecraft Assembly Facility**: A cleanroom wonderland where engineers in bunny suits build the next generation of spacefarers.
- **Europa Clipper & Mars Sample Return**: Upcoming missions that highlight NASA’s focus on astrobiology and sample return technologies.
- **Von Karman Museum**: A walk through JPL's history, from its Caltech rocket roots to today’s interplanetary missions.

### Using AI to Tell the Story

Rather than build the presentation by hand, I used an AI slide generator to handle most of the layout, draft much of the text, and even provide placeholder visuals. The AI nailed the structure—clean, well-paced, and easy to tweak. But since no algorithm can beat standing in front of the Mars Yard with your own camera, I swapped out many of the stock images with my own photos from the day.

This blend of automation and personalization felt like the best of both worlds. It allowed me to focus on storytelling and memory-making while the AI handled the grunt work of formatting and layout.

### Reflections

This project was both a tribute to JPL’s engineering excellence and a hands-on experiment in using AI tools to augment creativity. It was my first step into letting AI act as a co-creator for visual storytelling—and honestly, it won’t be my last.

If you’re curious about what it’s like to step inside one of the world’s leading centers for robotic space exploration, or you're considering trying AI tools for your next presentation, I hope this inspires you to take the leap.

**AI doesn’t replace the storyteller—it enhances the story.**

Stay curious,
