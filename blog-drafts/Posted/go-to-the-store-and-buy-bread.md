# Go to the Store and Buy Bread: Why Tech Docs Fail (and How Sparky Fixed It)

You know that viral video 🎥 where a dad is teaching his kids how to write instructions for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? The one where he deliberately follows their instructions to the letter—resulting in peanut butter getting slapped onto unopened bread bags and sealed jars—because they didn’t include the step where you open the jar first. 🥪

That’s exactly how learning technology has felt for me. 🤯

I’ve had lots of ideas 💡 for things I wanted to build—apps, tools, frameworks—big, exciting, innovative things. But every time I tried to dive in, I’d hit a wall. The documentation, the tutorials, the how-to guides... they all seemed to start halfway down the road. Somewhere around *“open the peanut butter jar”* or *“slice the bread”*—without ever telling me **how to get to the store and buy bread.** 🥖

No one explained the absolute first step. 🛣️

That’s because most tech documentation is written by people who forgot what it felt like to be new. Or worse, it’s written for people who’ve already been sitting at the table for years, fluent in a language I never learned. 🧠💬
They assume you already know the prerequisites, the vocabulary, the secret handshakes. 🤝

But I didn’t. 🚫
I didn’t go to Computers 101 school. 🎓
Everything I know, I learned on the job, in the trenches, through trial and error and a whole lot of Googling. 🔍
And when the instructions assumed I knew something I didn’t, I gave up. 😞

**Until I met Sparky. ⚡️**

### ✨ The Magic of Asking Dumb Questions

With Sparky, I can stop pretending I know where the store is. 🛒

I can say things like:

- **"Can you walk me through setting up GitHub Pages, like I’ve never used version control before?"** 🧩
- **"How do I connect Azure Functions to my React app—what even is a function endpoint?"** 🔗
- **"What’s the deal with Docker vs. Kubernetes? I hear the words but I don’t get the use case."** 🐳📦
- **"Can you show me how to SSH into something, but explain it like I’ve never opened a terminal before?"** 💻
- **"What even is a webhook, and how do I use one in a project?"** 🪝
- **"How do I turn a Google Doc into clean Markdown for my blog without weird formatting issues?"** 📝

These are **real questions I’ve actually asked Sparky.**
No gatekeeping. 🚫🚪
No judgment. 🧘‍♀️
No *"How did you get to be a senior developer without knowing that?"* 🙄

Just clear, kind, practical instructions, starting from Step Zero. 🪜
Starting from: **Go to the store and buy bread.** 🥖

### 🧠 The Bigger Lesson

If you’ve ever closed a tutorial halfway through because it assumed you already knew how to "open the jar," or stopped chasing an idea because the instructions made you feel stupid—you’re not alone. 🙈  
The instructions were incomplete. 📉  
The system wasn’t designed for you. 🧱

But that doesn’t mean you’re not capable. 💪  
It just means you need someone to start at the front door. 🚪

That’s what Sparky does for me. ⚡️  
And now, I’m finally building all those ideas I used to shelve. 🚀

**Coming Soon:** I’m putting together a series of *“Go Buy Bread” guides—tech how-tos that start from absolute zero.* If there’s something you’ve always felt too embarrassed to ask, drop it in the comments. 💬  
We’ll go to the store together. 🥖⚡️
