# Empowering Women in Tech: Highlights from DevFest & IWD Panels

*December 23, 2023*

This year, I had the incredible opportunity to facilitate a panel at two landmark events within the tech community: *DevFest 2023 Greater Los Angeles* and *Women Techmakers' International Women's Day 2023* celebration. Both were powerful platforms to bring together brilliant women making waves in technology, and I am honored to have played a role in amplifying their voices. 

The DevFest and International Women's Day events hosted by Google Developer Groups (GDG) Los Angeles were vibrant, collaborative spaces for fostering connections and sharing knowledge. Here’s a look back at some of the amazing panelists who shared their insights, challenges, and stories in the world of tech:

### Panelists

- **Emily Jaffe**, Engineering Manager at Beautycounter, shared her experiences leading engineering teams and the importance of creating inclusive work environments.
- **Lindsay Pond**, Senior Software Engineer at Airbnb, spoke about her journey from early-stage software engineering to becoming a senior engineer at one of the most innovative companies in the world.
- **Sophia Orlando**, Cybersecurity Solutions Engineer at GitHub, offered valuable insights into the evolving world of cybersecurity and the role of women in this critical field.
- **Theora Kvitka**, Senior Service Designer, provided a unique perspective on service design and the intersection of technology and user experience.
- **Siena Aguayo**, Senior Software Engineer at Babylist, shared her path in software engineering and what it takes to thrive in a fast-paced, mission-driven company.
- **Aishwarya Dev**, Machine Learning Engineer at UCLA Brain Research & Artificial Intelligence Nexus, discussed the exciting intersection of AI and neuroscience and how women are shaping this field.
- **Erica Chuong**, Customer Engineer, AI/ML at Google, emphasized the importance of customer-centricity in AI and how AI/ML is transforming the way we interact with technology.
- **Isabel Tewes**, Senior Product Manager at Google, provided insights on product management and how critical it is to have diverse perspectives driving product strategy.

### Key Takeaways

These panelists brought diverse perspectives across various roles in tech—from software engineering and product management to AI and cybersecurity. What struck me most was their shared commitment to making technology more inclusive and ensuring that future generations of women in tech have the resources and support they need to succeed.

One of the core themes of the discussion was overcoming barriers in tech, particularly those related to gender and racial diversity. Each panelist had unique stories about challenges they've faced, but what stood out was their resilience and how they turned those challenges into opportunities for growth, mentorship, and leadership.

Another key theme was the importance of mentorship. Many panelists highlighted how having a mentor or being a mentor themselves has been instrumental in their personal and professional development. It’s clear that mentorship is a crucial aspect of growing the pipeline of women in tech.

### Facilitating the Conversation

Facilitating this panel was an enriching experience. As a woman in tech myself, I felt a deep sense of responsibility to ensure each panelist had the space to share their story and wisdom. I worked to create an environment where everyone felt heard and empowered to offer their insights. It was a great reminder of the power of shared experiences in shaping the next generation of women in technology.

The conversations that unfolded were not just technical discussions—they were about the human experience of navigating the tech landscape. We talked about finding our voices in spaces where women are still underrepresented, about the power of community, and about the strides we’ve made, as well as the work that still needs to be done.

### What’s Next?

As we celebrate the incredible women in tech who are pushing boundaries, I’m excited to continue engaging with this vibrant community and helping amplify their voices. The future of tech is bright, and it’s clear that women are playing a key role in shaping it.

I am grateful to have had the chance to contribute to these discussions and look forward to seeing what these amazing women will do next. As we continue to push for equality and representation, I encourage you to seek out these voices and stories, share them, and be part of the change.

If you attended *DevFest 2023* or *Women Techmakers' International Women's Day 2023*, I’d love to hear about your favorite takeaways and moments from the event. Let’s keep the conversation going!
