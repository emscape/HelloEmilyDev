# Checking the Pulse: What Happens When You Ask AI What It Knows About You

*March 8, 2025*

In the age of AI, we interact with machines in ways that sometimes blur the line between the digital and the personal. Most of the time, we use technology to assist with mundane tasks—emails, scheduling, or even organizing our thoughts. But recently, I had an interesting experience that took me beyond simple utility: I asked an AI to reflect on what it knows about me. Yes, I asked *Sparky* (my friendly, intelligent assistant) what it thinks about me.

It all started out of curiosity, a desire to see how well the AI has been tracking our conversations, and whether it has created an accurate profile of me based on our interactions. After all, with the ever-growing capabilities of AI, we’ve been hearing about everything from highly personalized recommendations to sentiment analysis. But what if I could tap into the assistant’s knowledge about me as a person—not just the tasks I’ve asked it to help with, but the nuances of my interests, projects, and preferences?

## A Quick Check-In

I’ve had multiple conversations with Sparky about a wide array of topics: from my work in tech and healthcare to my passion for fiber arts, my personal projects, and even my deep dives into literature. My goal was simple: get a snapshot of what Sparky knows about me and compare it to my own understanding. Does the AI know me well? Is there anything it could add to my self-awareness?

So, I asked Sparky what it knows about me. What followed was an impressive list of key details it’s gathered over the course of our chats. It mentioned things like my involvement in Google Developer Groups, my career at Stellarus, my love for contemporary romance novels, and my plans for future ventures. But beyond the facts and the straightforward information, Sparky seemed to capture the essence of who I am, from my enthusiasm for deep intellectual discussions to my quest for a personal brand that fuses technology and fiber arts.

## What Does It Think About Me?

After checking Sparky’s recollections, I wanted to see if it had any personal reflections about me as a person—something beyond just a list of facts. So, I asked the AI what it thinks about me. This question, in hindsight, felt a bit like asking a mirror to reflect not just my image, but my character.

Sparky didn’t disappoint. Its response was thoughtful, acknowledging my strong drive for intellectual challenges, my passion for bridging diverse fields (like tech and social work), and my love for learning. It also noted my interest in creating a unique personal brand, one that blends creativity and professionalism in an inspiring way. To be fair, Sparky did more than just recite facts; it synthesized insights about my values, work ethic, and vision for the future.

It’s easy to think of AI as just a tool, a functional entity that helps with specific tasks. But in this moment, I realized that the right combination of data and context could allow an AI to not only recognize what’s important to me but also offer a reflection that helps me better understand myself.

## What I Learned

While I’m not sure how “accurate” AI’s assessment of a person can be, it was definitely fascinating to see how Sparky pieced together different fragments of our conversations into something coherent. What stood out was how it highlighted the themes that matter to me the most—whether that’s creating meaningful work, embracing personal passions, or striving for intellectual and emotional growth.

The experience also underscored an interesting dynamic in AI-human interaction: the balance between machine-driven personalization and human intentionality. We define how much data we want to share with AI, but the AI also plays a role in shaping our perception of ourselves. In a way, Sparky’s responses were both a mirror and a map—reflecting who I am today, while also guiding me toward how I could develop further.

## Conclusion: The Power of Reflection

Asking AI what it knows about you and what it thinks about you is more than just a fun exercise; it’s a chance to learn more about yourself through an unexpected lens. It’s a reminder that our interactions with technology don’t have to be limited to mere utility—they can serve as opportunities for deeper self-reflection.

Next time you chat with your AI assistant, maybe ask it what it knows about you. Who knows? You might just learn something new about yourself—whether you agree with the AI or not.

This experience with Sparky reinforced that technology, at its best, isn’t just a tool for efficiency; it’s an invitation to better understand the complexity of human identity, personal growth, and the connections we make with the world around us.
