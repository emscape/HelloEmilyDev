title: "The Dapper Foxes Wedding Website"
shortDescription: "A custom wedding site blending charm, tech, and personal storytelling."
longDescription: "We designed and built TheDapperFoxes.com to reflect not just our wedding plans, but our shared values in design, technology, and collaboration. The site features a guest photo gallery with approval workflow, a color-coded location poll, custom illustrations, and lovingly crafted UI elements. Built using Google Apps Script, GitHub Pages, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JSâ€”this was as much a professional showcase as it was a personal project."
