## The Challenge
The Google I/O 2025 puzzle consists of a series of increasingly difficult grid-based challenges where participants must connect nodes following specific rules. The puzzles test logical thinking, pattern recognition, and problem-solving skills.

## My Approach
I approached each puzzle methodically, first understanding the rules and constraints, then developing strategies for different puzzle types. For more complex puzzles, I created a systematic approach to eliminate impossible paths and identify optimal solutions.
