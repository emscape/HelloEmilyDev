GOAL: Fix broken images in blog posts by correcting inconsistent image path handling

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Identified inconsistent image path formats in blog-index.json (some paths missing leading '/')
2. Fixed all featuredImage paths in blog-index.json to use consistent root-relative format (/images/...)
3. Updated scripts/md-to-blog.js to include normalizeImagePath function for consistent path handling
4. Enhanced path normalization in markdown-to-HTML conversion for inline images
5. Verified all referenced featured images exist in the file system
6. REMOVED all banner image functionality to simplify the system (per user request)

SPECIFIC CHANGES:
- blog-index.json: Fixed paths for augment-fail-bot.png, go-to-the-store-and-buy-bread, humans-have-ideas, and jpl-ai-blog featured images
- scripts/md-to-blog.js: Added normalizeImagePath function, applied it to featuredImage processing, and removed all bannerImage logic
- js/blog-post.js: Removed all banner image rendering code
- All image paths now consistently start with '/' for root-relative addressing
- Banner images completely removed from the blog system for simplicity
